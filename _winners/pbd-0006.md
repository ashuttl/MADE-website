A credit union that moves with its members. That was the vision behind our concept for Bellwether, a brand built on momentum, connection, and progress—just like the members it serves across New Hampshire. At the heart of the identity was the Community Flywheel, a symbol of unity and forward motion, representing optimism, diversity, and collective strength. The identity extended seamlessly across digital banking, social, and real-world experiences, creating a system that felt bold, modern, and effortless. Clean typography, warm colors, and thoughtful layouts made every touchpoint intuitive—because banking should move at the speed of life, not slow you down. While this version didn't make it into the world, it remains a vision of what credit unions can be when they put people at the center of everything they do.
