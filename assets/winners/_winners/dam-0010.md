Practical Pomology is a field guide focused on apple identification in Maine, created to be a resource for growers, foragers, and anyone interested in apple varieties. The authors approached us to produce a video to support their crowdfunding campaign. We filmed at a historic orchard, interviewing the authors about their goals for the book and their process in compiling it. To visually connect the project to the landscape that inspired it, we followed them on an orchard tour and captured b-roll during golden hour for a natural, warm look that evokes the magic of "the world of apples". The final video aimed to introduce the authors, explain the book's purpose, and give viewers a clear reason to purchase the book. The launch was a success as the Kickstarter-based launch campaign raised over $45,000.
