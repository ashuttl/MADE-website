Aroma Joe's, one of the fastest-growing franchises in the country, sought to build brand recognition in highly competitive new markets. To address this, we crafted a dynamic brand evolution and vibrant campaign platform designed to engage a younger audience while remaining adaptable to different franchise locations. The strategy focused on creating a visual identity and tone that can resonate across diverse markets. With the use of vibrant brand colors, new dynamic product photography, and standardized clear, simplified messaging, we fully revamped AJ's POP advertising. This approach not only drove consumer engagement but also improved store efficiency, benefiting both customers and throughput. The result is a versatile system of seasonal and brand assets that enhances recognition and supports the franchise's expansion.
