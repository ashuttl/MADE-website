A beloved Maine business, Agren is a go-to for home appliances, but most consumers had no idea they sold mattresses â€” and good ones, at that. This work is as humorous as it is hardworking, using a repetition device to instill a simple message into viewers' minds, while breaking category norms and getting some laughs along the way.
