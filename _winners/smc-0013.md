Guided Marketing has built a dynamic social media presence for Shipyard Brewing to strengthen the power of Pumpkinhead â€“ the #1 fall seasonal beer in New England. Our brand awareness campaign on social media has helped retain Pumpkinhead's market share in the fiercely competitive craft beer category. Always on trend and shareable with friends, we create content that converts. During the last 2 Pumpkinhead Seasons, we've organically generated 345,000 content interactions on Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok. Our success on social media keeps Pumpkinhead top of mind with consumers during the limited sales period. These engagements aren't just limited to the digital space. We've brought the infamous Pumpkinhead Pete to life by documenting his adventures and building experiential marketing events like the Pumpkinhead Rave. Our fans have been so inspired by these efforts, they gladly carve giant jack-o-lanterns and wear them on their heads for our UGC campaigns.
