## Campaign Strategy

The "Find Your Maine Thing" campaign targeted potential visitors from Boston, New York, and Philadelphia markets, encouraging them to discover Maine during spring and fall seasons. Using a mix of out-of-home, digital, social media, and traditional print advertising, the campaign highlighted Maine's natural beauty, outdoor activities, and unique culinary experiences.

## Results

The campaign resulted in a 24% increase in website traffic to visitmaine.com during the promotional period and a 12% increase in shoulder season bookings as reported by participating hotels and attractions. Social media engagement increased by 35% over the previous year's campaign.

## Design Approach

The visual language combined breathtaking photography of Maine's landscapes with simple, elegant typography and the strategic use of white space. The color palette shifted between warm autumn tones and cool coastal colors based on the targeted season.
