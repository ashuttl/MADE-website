A new way to play and a new, fun experience was coming to Maine. With the launch of CashPOP, draw games were going to look a lot different, and we wanted a campaign that did justice to the new offering. Enter: Make it POP! With a contemporary exuberance and a fast-paced style, we were able to capture the benefit of the game while showing consumers how to play and making sure they knew that winning was just one number away. We drove awareness through statewide TV and video, offered users a quick tutorial with an engaging how-to-play video, and made the game's presence felt on-site with a bright, vibrant point of sale pieces. The result was a successful launch that drove gameplay and saw users fully embrace a new style of lottery play.
