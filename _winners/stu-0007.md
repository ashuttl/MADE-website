Sorority is a magazine. It is a lifestyle. It is a sisterhood. Sorority was first created as a tongue-in-cheek way for me to practice editorial design but has since blossomed into a complete set of magazine covers, interior concept layouts, and a fully realized manifesto book. Community is more important than ever in today's ever-changing and uncertain world. Sorority breaks down the idea of a traditional sisterhood and creates an inclusive space for anyone who feels they are a part of the 'sorority' to create, read, write, and make art. The masthead on each issue intentionally differs, as Sorority constantly evolves in its own way. This is an ongoing project through which I have experimented with photography, typeface design, illustration, and editorial design. I have also developed a unified voice in branding through the magazine's logo, ongoing editions, and design as a whole.
