Theoretical branding system for the 2024 AIGA Boston Fellow Awards. This brand design was meant to capture the attention of other designers and the future of graphic design. I pushed for this through a bold, playful color palette and an abstract-futuristic logomark. I played with exposing the grid and alluding to pixels through the use of rounded forms, as this is something graphic designers can understand and relate to. The scope includes a logo, square social media posts, mockups, and three posters. This project was done for my Branding and Visual Systems class.
