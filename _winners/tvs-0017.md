The "Still a Pahty" campaign is the latest execution under Big Y's "Nicely Done" platform, celebrating the communal spirit of Super Bowl Sunday—even when your team isn't in the game. With three beloved franchises—Patriots, Jets, and Giants—missing from the Big Game, the campaign leans into the shared disappointment of their fans. But rather than dwell on the misery, it finds the silver lining: no matter what happens on the field, the party still goes on. At the heart of the campaign is a high-energy, humor-driven broadcast and digital spot, where dejected New England and New York fans arrive at a Big Game party, burdened by their teams' failures. However, as they dig into Big Y's fresh party platters, 30" grinders, and piping-hot pizza, the mood shifts. Their tragic fandom takes a backseat to undeniable fun, and a simple, rallying phrase emerges: "It's still a pahty."
