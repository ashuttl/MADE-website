Backriver Blends brings the authentic, bold flavors of Jamaica to everyone, regardless of dietary restrictions. The branding, which was inspired by Founder Jordene's childhood growing up among the hills and rivers of Jamaica, came to life through the packaging for her two signature marinades. The B/B monogram icon is meant to evoke the image of a mountain along a river, with its reflection showing just below. The symmetry also alludes to the mirroring of Jordene's two homes in Jamaica and Maine. The brand pattern is prominently featured as a backdrop for the product line with a shimmering matte metallic. Jordene crafts her products with her family in mind, and as a busy Mom to a daughter with food sensitivities, she wanted packaging that would reflect the simple, but high-quality ingredients in her products. With thoughtful metallic touches and bold colors, the labels are eye-catching on store shelves.
