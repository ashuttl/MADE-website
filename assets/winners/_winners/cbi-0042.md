We partnered with Rising Tide Brewing to deliver a full brand refresh that honored its Maine roots while positioning it for growth. The work included a new logo system, coastal-inspired color palette, updated typography, and a flexible label architecture built for expansion. We developed an identity system that works across merchandise, signage, and taproom assets. The result was a cohesive, modern identity with real-world impact: Rising Tide was acquired by another Maine brewery just six months after the relaunch.
