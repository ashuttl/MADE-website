With Lucky Cheetah, we undertook the challenge of creating a brand that rang true to the rich traditions of Cantonese cuisine and cast it in a modern context. Our brand identity system conveys a lounge atmosphere paired with innovative fine dining. We drew from mid-century finishings, calligraphic inspired typography, and classic Chinese zodiacs to create a series of marks and illustrations used across plate ware, signage, menus, and interiors.
