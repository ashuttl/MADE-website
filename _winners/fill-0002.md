The Portland Hearts of Pine begin their inaugural season in May, and despite not yet playing a game, have introduced themselves as a community-driven soccer club for all of Maine to support. I was tasked with designing multiple items for the team's first merch drop, targeting the entire state's soccer community, from the kids playing the game, to parents and coaches across Maine. The Hearts' aim is to have their branded merchandise feel like a lifestyle brand that soccer fans and non-soccer fans alike can enjoy and wear with pride for the state of Maine. My illustrations include a 'Support Maine Soccer' badge that was used on t-shirts, stickers and magnets, a map of the state of Maine announcing the Hearts as 'The Soccer Club of Maine' and showcasing all the places, animals, and objects that make up this state, and a take on Maine's iconic Moxie soda label.
