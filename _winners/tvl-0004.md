Hannaford is one of the good guys. They were "local" before local was cool. Since 1883 they have been partnering with local food producers, helping them to flourish and nourish our community. Their Local Roots run deep, and it's not just about business, it's about a shared commitment to fresh food, reducing waste, and strengthening our region's fundamental ability to feed itself. This campaign shines a light on that commitment through truly compelling storytelling and elevated visuals. Everyone that worked on it cared a whole lot, and we think it shows.
