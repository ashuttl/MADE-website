This animation was created to hype the release of the Harley-Davidson Pan America adventure truck designed by the creative team at Trigger(House in Portsmouth, NH. The brief was to dynamically depict how they transformed a Ford F-350 pickup into a custom behemoth that matched the off-road performance of the H-D Pan America series of motorcycles. To complete the animation, I adapted a stock 3D model with custom modeled upgrades, accessories, and trailer based on specs from T(H. Both this animation and the assembled truck went live in the summer of 2024.
