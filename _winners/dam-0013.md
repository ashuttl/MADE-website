To increase awareness, drive trial, and inspire usage of Vaseline Lip Therapy among 18–34-year-olds in North America, Rinck launched the "Why So Dry?" campaign during the X-Games in Aspen, Colorado. With cold temps and chapped lips everywhere, the event provided the perfect opportunity to connect with our target audience. Rinck distributed 15,000 Lip Therapy sticks and captured candid, cheeky interviews with attendees at the top and bottom of the mountain, highlighting real conversations about dry lips and the benefits of 48-hour moisture. A custom selfie stick ensured the product stayed front and center in the content. The campaign ran February 3–March 21, delivering over 66 million impressions and reaching more than 21 million across Meta and TikTok. With 25 compelling video assets, the "Why So Dry?" campaign broke through the noise—driving awareness and foot traffic to retailers by putting Vaseline Lip Therapy in hands, gloves, and hearts.
