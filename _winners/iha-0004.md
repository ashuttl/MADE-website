Our objective was to spread the word about our Community Partners, their efforts, and how Evergreen Credit Union (EGCU) supports them. This exploration ultimately allowed our team to add video to our social media content strategy on Facebook and Instagram. EGCU establishes Community Partnerships with organizations that are the heartbeat of Maine's culture. Our in-house marketing team not only provides financial assistance, but also gives our time, expertise, and enthusiasm for southern Maine's community development to their team. Our team provided footage from Community Partner events we attended, creative direction, and feedback to a trusted video editor who used it to create narrative videos we could post. Ultimately, we published 1-2 finished videos per week and added to our daily social media content strategy. We found that video content was more digestible to not just our followers, but those we reach organically and gave much-needed promotion to our Community Partners.
