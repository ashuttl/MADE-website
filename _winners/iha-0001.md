Driven by a desire to create a cohesive and forward-looking identity, I led the rebranding initiative for Thomas College to reflect how the institution is evolving as a dynamic and innovative leader in higher education. The previous visual elements felt disjointed and did not effectively capture the college's identity. Through research and surveys of students, alumni, staff, and faculty, it became clear there was a need for a unified brand that better represents the Terrier community. The new logo features white lettering on a vibrant red background, symbolizing the college's bright future while honoring its 130-year history. Alongside the logo are an updated presidential seal, a refined color palette, and a comprehensive visual identity toolkit. A new terrier icon, inspired by the "Tommy the Terrier" statue, was also introduced as a unifying symbol across both institutional and athletic branding.
