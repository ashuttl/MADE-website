Manifesto: If you're from New England, you know health looks different here. Our seasons are shorter. Our layers get thicker. The warmth is savored. The cold is embraced. This campaign for our Medicare Advantage Plans sought to celebrate what health looks like for the people we serve everyday in New England. It's a game of cribbage over coffee. It's a brisk dip in the ocean at sunset. It's a lively night of contra dancing with your friends and family. At Martin's Point, we're close to home, so we can stay close to heart. Coverage you need, from people who care. Strategy: This campaign was our first tangible representation of our brand evolution: Simple. Relatable. Close to home. Retirement can feel daunting and healthcare can be sterile. Featuring real people in our own backyard, we sought to challenge those stereotypes, showcasing our Medicare-eligible individuals as brave, independent, and full of life.
