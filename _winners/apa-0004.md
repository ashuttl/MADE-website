The Nature Conservancy of Maine aimed to connect with a younger audience during their Join Maine campaign for climate action. To help achieve this, we recommended leveraging their existing partnership with outdoor influencer Aislinn Sarnacki on southern Maine's most popular morning radio show, The Blake Show with Kelly and Todd. To keep the segment engaging and fun, we developed a series of nature quizzes that ranged from the silly to the sexy, highlighting quirky and unexpected facts about Maine's wildlife. This playful approach not only entertained listeners unlikely to be aware of TNC but also reinforced their mission in a memorable and shareable way.
