Climate change can be polarizing, so when working with the The Nature Conservancy of Maine, we needed a way to connect with Mainers and inspire action. The answer was obviousâ€”weather. Mainers love checking it, talking about it, and being out in it. And they trust local weather reporters like Todd Gutner from NewsCenter Maine. So, we used Todd and the weather as a unifying way to reframe climate change. This campaign was developed around a 30-second spot that began as a typical weather report but shifted into a climate PSA, supported by engaging social sketches highlighting concerning weather trends. While the work was fully developed, it was ultimately ditched before going live.
