The agency was tasked with both creating awareness for the new program and encouraging people to take an online genetic cancer risk assessmentâ€”a lead funnel for new patients. The agency's animated executions were grounded in the iconic imagery of a ribbon that is often associated with various national cancer awareness days. In each execution, the flowing ribbon continually morphs into imagery that portrays the rational benefits of genetic testing.
