The Nature Conservancy has a strong but aging donor base and needed to reach a younger generation to continue fueling its conservation goals. But while younger generations are deeply passionate about taking real, tangible action to address climate change, TNC was struggling to motivate them amidst a cluttered, often bleak climate conversation. Unlike older generations, Gen Z has a strong baseline knowledge of climate challenges. So instead of focusing on awareness of the issues, we built a campaign focused on demonstrating what taking action and making progress look like â€“ all in the language of Gen Z, in places where they already are, even when it wasn't where TNC has traditionally been. As a result, we met and exceeded the "Join Maine" Capital Campaign donation goal of $130M by raising over $200M before the end of the 18-month timeline.
