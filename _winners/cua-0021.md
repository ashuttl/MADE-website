Beaver Creek is a luxury vacation home with a built in air strip, cedar hot tub, and any amenity you could dream up! The design process began with a weekend in the woods at the cabin with my friends. Getting to see how guests vibes with the cabin helped guide the look and feel of the design process. All illustration was hand drawn based off photos taken during the weekend.
