I was assigned to design a series of posters showcasing architectural events throughout the city of Portland, Maine. Each poster was inspired by Portland's architectural styles, including Modern, Gothic, and Classical Revival. These three styles are the foundations of architecture across the world, so I wanted to incorporate the motif of threes throughout my designs. To represent each movement visually, I broke each style down to its most basic geometric shape: a square for Modern, a triangle for Gothic, and a circle for Classical Revival. In addition, I used a primary color palette of red yellow and blue to emphasize these styles as foundational movements of architecture to unify the posters as a set. Each poster is 18" x 24" created in Maya Autodesk and Adobe Photoshop, allowing me to blend three-dimensional forms and two-dimensional typography to encapsulate the feeling of real architecture that interacts with the space around it.
