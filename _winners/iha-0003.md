Maine College of Art & Design's (MECA&D) third edition of & Magazine showcases the diverse network of artists, designers, and storytellers who are the fabric of the MECA&D community. & Magazine is an opportunity to connect more deeply with our varied audiences by presenting an in-depth range of storiesâ€”from the business of pottery, to landscapes that explore themes of economics and the American dream, to spectral photography connected to the land. Collectively, & Magazine highlights the unbridled creativity bursting forth from the College. As you dig in, the stories about artists, writers, curators, students, and educators give us hope that art and artists have the power to change how people think and inspire change.
