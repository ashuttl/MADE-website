Odie Leigh is an American singer songwriter that I was lucky enough to do the tour poster merch line for. Her debut tour, Carrier Pigeon took place in 3 countries and was 54 stops. The process started with getting early access to the record and really immersing myself in the words and feelings of the music. We wanted the merch poster to be fun and not too precious while showing every stop on the tour as a custom stamp. Each stamp was its own little mini project centering around our carrier pigeon.... researching the venue, location and lore behind each stop was such a fun aspect of the illustration process. From snowboarding in CO, to hanging in the harbor of Portland, ME this Pigeon went through it all. Deliverables included 54 custom stamps, a sticker sheet, a 7 color screen printed tour poster, post cards shirts.
