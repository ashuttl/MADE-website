Maine faces a significant challenge with suicide, ranking 15th nationally for its suicide rate. The state's suicide rate exceeds that of any other northeastern state and is 15â€“20% higher than the national average. The Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) provides resources and support for those struggling with mental health and suicidal ideations. The Here to Help Maine campaign aims to generate awareness and education of these resources. The 2024 campaign had to address a community rocked by a mass shooting, emphasizing the critical need for accessible mental health resources and healthy coping strategies.
