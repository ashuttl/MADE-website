After a five-year hiatus, Furby was slated to make its triumphant return. Now, we just had to get the word out so Furby was EVERYWHERE during the holidays. And let's be honest: the world loves a reboot. We decided to re-launch Furby as though they were a celebrity re-entering the spotlight with Lance Bass and Josh Peck. They're no strangers to the public eye, and they've had their own career ebbs and flows. Lance recently teased an â€˜NSync reunion and Josh is enjoying a resurgence on TikTok. We partnered to create content where they gave Furby advice on how to get back out there and be the freest, fullest version of themselves. Then, we brought in Millennial influencers and gave people a reason to relive the golden age of Furby. Creators "interviewed" Furby and got the lowdown on where they've been, what they're up to, and what's still to come.
