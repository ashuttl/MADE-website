The Last Yztari - feature documentary promotional trailer. After using her body as a shield to protect her unit from an IED in Iraq, Mary is left medically retired, missing both arms from the elbow down. Many years after returning home, she finds a new place in online gaming communities as she adapts her controllers to work with her feet. When her husband readies to deploy again Mary is faced with the trauma of the past and the worry for her partner's yet to be diagnosed PTSD. The film explores the liminal space between trauma and healing, and this world and a fantasy space where old woundings might present themselves as future insights or abilities. The film weaves observational documentary with an original generative AI system built from Mary's own fantasy novel. The novel itself a secret only revealed to the filmmakers and her husband after seven years of writing.
