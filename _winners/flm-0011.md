The inspiration behind Argenta comes from Owner Ryan's Southwestern roots. His "lager saloon" brings a unique, wild west atmosphere to Portland's Bayside neighborhood. I digitized my original illustrations to create a full branding suite with alternate logos to bring this vision to life. I also painted two murals in the brewery as well as designed can labels for Argenta based on this branding. Yeehaw!
