We launched a new global comms platform for Clarks – For the World Ahead (FTWA) – underpinned by an inspiring new mission, values and an evolved sustainability & CSR platform (Every Move Matters). Consumer reaction was strong, and Clarks believed that the platform had longevity as a ‘call to arms' for their brand and business. They wanted FTWA to reach all aspects of the organization, infiltrating their internal and corporate comms with the same inspiring message. We were tasked with updating all internal communications touchpoints, from onboarding materials, to office signage, to drive an emotional response with Clarks internal audiences (people, partners & prospects) by evolving the campaign in a way that's progressive and premium.
