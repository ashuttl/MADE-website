Roost set out to bring clarity, quality, and peace of mind to the often chaotic world of home repair—especially for busy, high-end homeowners in Southern Maine. With a curated network of skilled tradespeople and a single point of contact, Roost makes it easy to manage everything from window rot to deck repairs with clear estimates, responsive communication, and real progress updates. The identity needed to feel professional yet warm—trustworthy without being dry. The resulting brand system strikes that balance through a confident color palette, friendly type, and a distinctive mark that combines a rooster and tools—symbolizing both dependability and craft. From logomark to messaging, every detail was designed to help Roost stand out in a crowded category and signal a new, more enjoyable way to get things done around the house.
