To address rising cancer care demands and raise awareness for its $36 million cancer center expansion, MaineGeneral Health partnered with Rinck Advertising on an integrated awareness campaign surrounding in its annual Day of Hope event. With 2,000 new consults annually, the Harold Alfond Center for Cancer Care serves 12% of Maine's cancer patients, prompting the need for increased capacity. The campaign focused on the message "We're Here"â€”reassuring patients that exceptional, compassionate care is available close to home. A poignant :30 video anchored a multi-platform effort across TV/OTT, YouTube, radio, and print supported by geo-targeted digital and social media ads and always-on search. Results exceeded goals: Day of Hope attracted 1,200 participants and raised over $240,000, surpassing fundraising and attendance targets. YouTube view rates leading up to the event were 57% above benchmark. The campaign effectively reinforced MaineGeneral as the cancer care provider of choice for the Kennebec Valley and beyond.
