Maine isn't just a place—it's a way of life. It's craftsmanship passed down through generations, the rhythm of the tides shaping rocky shores, and homes that feel like they belong as much as the trees and stone that surround them. The Knickerbocker Group has spent over four decades designing, building, and caring for homes that honor this connection, blending timeless artistry with modern livability. Their new website needed to do the same. More than a portfolio, it was an invitation into a world where every detail tells a story. Built from the ground up, this fully custom site mirrors the elegance and intention of Knickerbocker's work. Expansive photography draws visitors into handcrafted spaces, while refined typography, subtle motion, and navigation reflect the firm's holistic approach. Like the homes they create, the website is built to endure—a digital reflection of their work and commitment to excellence.
