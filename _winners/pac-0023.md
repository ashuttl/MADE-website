Wolverine has been handcrafting boots for 140 years. To celebrate their anniversary and honor the brand's legacy in an exciting way, we were tasked with helping the brand design, package, and launch an ultra-limited edition of their iconic 1000 Mile Boot. The 140th Anniversary 1000 Mile Boot was inspired by the first 1000 Mile that was introduced over a century ago. Not only was the archival style brought back, but so was the original price. To celebrate the milestone, 140 people were given the opportunity to enter a lottery to purchase the Boot for just $1.40. The launch garnered significant buzz and press.
