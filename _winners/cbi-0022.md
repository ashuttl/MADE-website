Set along Midcoast Maine's Route One, Camp DeForest revives the nostalgia of a classic New England camp—without the bug juice or bunk beds. We created a full visual identity for this reimagined roadside retreat, establishing a playful yet respectful brand system rooted in summer camp memories, seaside adventure, and thoughtful hospitality. The logotype, tree seal, and supporting marks are paired with a deep forest palette and vintage-inspired typography that feel right at home on trail signs, cabin doors, or embroidered patches. Graphic elements like custom patterns and location-specific marks nod to both place and personality. The language and collateral support an immersive guest experience: counselors instead of staff, campers instead of guests, and a tone that balances warmth, curiosity, and make-believe. Every design decision invites guests to play along, embracing the charm of camp life—just a little more comfortable (and better designed).
