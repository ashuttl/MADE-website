## Leadership positions

We’re currently looking both for regular board members and for individuals to fill specific leadership roles. If you’re interested in helping to guide the direction of MADE and support our mission, we’d love to hear from you!


### President
The MADE board president steers the whole ship! The president oversees program development, membership outreach, and budget planning for the organization. This person should embody the MADE mission, as they are often the face and primary representative of the club.

### Vice President
The VP supports the president in overseeing and guiding the board. This person should also embody the spirit of MADE, and will work in close collaboration with the president to ensure all projects are executed appropriately.

### Treasurer
The Treasurer, along with the executive team, “owns” the MADE budget. They are responsible for ensuring all MADE transactions are executed appropriately, by managing accounts, issuing checks, and ensuring compliance with all regulatory stakeholders.

### Secretary
The Secretary is tasked with keeping the board organized and, when necessary, tasked with record keeping. Often this person also takes a general leadership role- spearheading program development or communications.
