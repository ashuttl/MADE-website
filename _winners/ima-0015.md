Bangor International Airport's "Savvy Traveler" campaign introduces a charming, fictional spokesperson—a blend of wit, warmth, and wisdom—to boost brand awareness and increase passenger numbers without relying on fare promotions. With a fully integrated strategy across TV, radio, social media, digital, print, and blog content, "The Savvy Traveler" shares travel tips, highlights amenities, and brings a relatable voice to BGR's messaging. With a $150,000 budget, the campaign delivers consistent storytelling and personality-driven content that builds trust and connection. Early results show strong momentum: a 11.57% monthly passenger increase, growing social engagement, higher blog traffic, and a lift in regional brand visibility. Videos, strategic print placements, digital ads, and a branded blog series help position BGR as the preferred airport for central, eastern, and northern Maine, as well as Atlantic Canada. "The Savvy Traveler" doesn't just promote the airport—she becomes the friendly, go-to guide travelers turn to again and again.
