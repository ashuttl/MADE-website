A brand's identity isn't just what you see—it's what you hear. As part of Lighthouse Credit Union's groundbreaking rebrand, we developed a fully custom sonic identity, ensuring that every sound, every note, and every word reflected their mission: banking that makes change. From the moment the spot begins, the audio is warm, modern, and intentional—just like Lighthouse itself. The script delivers a clear, purpose-driven message, seamlessly reinforcing Lighthouse's commitment to financial empowerment and community impact. Every tap of a debit card isn't just a transaction—it's an opportunity to earn, to give, and to create change. Strategic placements across streaming, radio, and digital channels ensured the ad reached the right audience in high-impact moments, building recognition while reinforcing Lighthouse's smart, mission-driven approach to banking. More than a commercial, this was an audible extension of the brand—one that lights the way forward.
