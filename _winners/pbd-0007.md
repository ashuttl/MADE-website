Landscape architecture is about more than shaping outdoor spaces—it's about creating living, breathing works of art. Our concept for Gregory Lombardi was designed to reflect that philosophy: a brand identity as refined, intentional, and timeless as the landscapes they craft. The approach was elegantly restrained, balancing heritage with modernity. A typographic system inspired by classic proportions and architectural detailing mirrored the structured beauty of their designs, while the subtle logomark symbolized balance, precision, and nature in harmony. Beyond the identity, the design language extended into printed materials, signage, and digital touchpoints, ensuring a seamless experience at every interaction. The brand exuded quiet confidence, letting the work speak for itself—just like Lombardi's landscapes. Though this direction didn't move forward, we still believe in its essence: a brand as timeless and enduring as the environments it helps create.
