As a freelance designer for Blaze Partners, I crafted the Maine Outdoor Economy Roadmap to turn dense economic strategy into an engaging, easy-to-digest visual guide. Designed for policymakers, business leaders, and outdoor industry champions, the roadmap balances credibility with clarity—using a refined layout, custom icons, and vibrant infographics to make complex information feel approachable and enjoyable. But the impact didn't stop at the roadmap. The color palette and brand identity extended across social media graphics, a website landing page, printed mailings and invites, custom presentation graphics, and event signage. Unveiled at the Maine Outdoor Economy Summit, this design system didn't just look good on paper—it helped rally stakeholders, spark conversations, and drive real investment in Maine's outdoor economy for years to come.
