Girls on the Run, a nonprofit organization focused on empowering young girls through after-school programs and 5K events, required a versatile video to achieve 3 distinct goals: 1. Increase awareness of their mission to inspire fundraising and community support. 2. Recruit mentors and coaches to support their programs. 3. Showcase their impact to school principals to encourage adoption of the program in more schools. Fuseideas proposed a comprehensive video production approach. The project spanned two days of filming to capture the program's full scope and emotional resonance. We conducted interviews with participants, mentors, parents, and the Executive Director to create authentic and powerful testimonials. These real-life scenarios not only showcased the organization's mission, but also delivered emotional narratives and concrete benefits into a cohesive story.
