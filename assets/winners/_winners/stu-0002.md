I created this spec ad because I love these headphones. Excluding the gear my team already has, we spent around $40 total the day we filmed this. We focused mainly on creating something practical, stylized, and effective. Making sure our visuals and vision matched, I am very proud of how this came out. Unfortunately it has yet to meet the eyes of a Bose employee, but I have done lots of outreach!
