Believe it or not, there aren't a lot of young people clamoring to sell insurance. And the negative stigma around the industry has stifled recruitment efforts for years. So we decided to call a spade a spade and flip the whole thing on its head to showcase the many pros of selling insurance with Colonial Life. Colonial Life was able to significantly exceed their recruitment goals, driving 13 new agents a week (up from 1-2 prior to campaign launch). Within only 4 months, traffic on the landing page increased to an average of 651 new users per day from the pre-campaign average of 9.7 users (a 6,611% increase), and the daily average of total application form submissions increased by 147%.
