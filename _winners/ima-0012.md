The insurance industry has a negative stigma and dated image that can make it unattractive for young people looking for jobs. Colonial Life needed to combat the negative perception to recruit the right agents. We turned popular "dream" careers on their heads by showcasing the many pros of selling Colonial Life insurance. Then followed that up with a strategic roll-out and independent agent recruitment toolkit to ensure we armed our most important brand ambassadors with the right tools to do their job, and do it well. Colonial Life was able to significantly exceed their recruitment goals, driving 13 new agents a week (up from 1-2 prior to campaign launch). Within only 4 months, traffic on the landing page increased to an average of 651 new users per day from the pre-campaign average of 9.7 users (a 6,611% increase), and the daily average of total application form submissions increased by 147%.
