The Nature Conservancy launched the Join Maine campaign not only to raise $130 million for climate action initiatives, but also to introduce their mission to younger generations who may not yet be familiar with their work. Recognizing that Gen Z and Millennials have a strong understanding of climate issues, we focused on reaching them where they already areâ€”even in spaces where TNC hasn't traditionally had a presence. Through our partnership with REVERB, we connected with this younger audience in an unexpected place: the summer concert series at Thompson's Point. Our bold, eye-catching creative covered REVERB's water bottle refill station, inspiring over 39,000 fan actions and preventing the use of more than 37,000 single-use water bottles. Additionally, our signage provided a platform to spotlight a local nonprofit, Sebago Clean Waters, further amplifying the impact of our presence.
