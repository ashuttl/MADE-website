iBec worked with Maine Spirits to create a fun, engaging, and silly take on AI generated content. CocktailBot 5000 (CB5K) is an AI experiment that allows users to generate their own unique cocktail recipes with AI. Throughout late 2023 and 2024, iBec rebranded CB5K for Halloween, the winter holidays, and Cinco de Mayo. Visitors could choose a spirit-type and a flavor profile, and CB5K would use the power of AI to generate a unique cocktail recipe and photo to accompany it. Leaning into the absurdity of AI generated content, cocktail results were often unpredictable, goofy, and odd in the way that early AI could only be.
